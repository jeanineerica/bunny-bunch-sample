        <h1>Marlene</h1>
          <p>Marlene was spotted by a volunteer in a local shelter in Southern California. When the volunteer noticed Marlene was not in good health, she called Caroline to help. Marlene was then taken to Bunny Bunch in Orange County where Caroline noticed right away the discoloration of her fur and bald irritated skin, a direct result of being in a small, unclean cage. By first look, one would not be able to tell Marlene is bony and most likely undernourished. An emaciated body could be from a problem with the teeth, so it's recommended to check the mouth as well.  It's important to remember to never bathe rabbits, they must only be groomed, however in some cases like this, Marlene will be bottom bathed to begin the healing process. </p>

        <h4>Marlene in the Angel Program</h4>
        <p>Marlene is settled in nicely and will be cared for by Caroline until she is back in good health. It is important when caring for any undernourished bunny, to not allow them to over eat. She will be watched closely and fed a balanced diet of hay, pellets, and veggies.</p>

        <p>Bunny Bunch is able to care for Marlene through the Angel Program. All too often rabbits are taken to vets or shelters to be euthanized because their humans are not willing to care for them. It is very common for us to get a call from a person that has just found a sick or injured rabbit in the street. Our Angel Fund helps these rabbits.</p>
   
        <p>By donating to our Angel Fund you will be helping us save the lives of those who need it most. You can donate <a href="http://www.bunnybunch.org/donations.htm">online now</a>. Or, you can come by the Burrow to give a donation, or send a check to Bunny Bunch Angel Fund, PO Box 2583, Chino, CA 91708. With your donation of $50 or more you will receive a color photo of an Angel Bunny as a thank you for your support.</p>
         
        <p>Here at the Bunny Bunch we fall in love with all of our rescued rabbits. The Angel bunnies have a special place in our hearts as we often stay up with them night and day through their sickness or injuries, syringe feeding them, giving them medication, fluids and lots of TLC.</p>
         
        <p>Because of our volunteers and supporters like you, these rabbits are saved!  We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
